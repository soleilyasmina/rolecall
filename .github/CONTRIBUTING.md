## Git Conventions

Here's a brief list of the Git conventions when contributing to the repository:

1. please do not merge your fork's `main` branch, please do so through a branch,
2. please merge to the `development` branch as opposed to the `main` branch, as the `main` branch is for releases,
3. only declare new git tag / package.json versions on `main`,
4. naming conventions are:
    - `doc/some-docs` for documentation updates
    - `feature/some-feature` for feature branches
    - `fix/some-fix` for bug fixes
    - `refactor/some-refactor` 

## Style Conventions

When working in Node.js, please use 2 spaces for your tabs. This generally follows the [airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). When working on documentation, please use [Alex](https://alexjs.com/) to lint your Markdown.
